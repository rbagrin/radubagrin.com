        Gross Rental Yield is a financial metric used in real estate to assess
        the potential profitability of an investment property. It is expressed
        as a percentage and is calculated by taking the annual rental income
        generated by the property and dividing it by the property's total cost
        or market value. The formula for Gross Rental Yield is as follows:

      <MathJax hideUntilTypeset={"first"}>
        {`\\[GrossRentalYield =\\left(\\frac{AnnualRent}{PurchasePrice}\\right)*100%\\]`}

        What is a good rental yield â€“ and where can I get it?

        As a rule of thumb, between <b>6%</b> and <b>8%</b> is considered to be
        a <b>reasonable</b> level of rental yield, but different parts of the
        country can deliver significantly higher or lower returns. It is worth
        bearing in mind that yields can be lower in areas where the expected
        house price growth is highest, such as in London and the South East of
        England. This is because the potential for capital gains in the region
        pushes sale prices up, while rent levels are less affected.
